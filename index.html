                        Bob Ong is a Filipino writer and author known for his controversial 
                        writing techniques. 
                        Throughout his work, the problems and issues of the country are shown by reflecting on the Philippines' life. 
                        Ong pursued his passion for writing after dropping out of college.
                        Bob Ong is not his real name. It is a pseudonym that he made when he was working as web designer and teacher. 
                        </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Bob Ong has published numerous books, 
                        six of them having sold millions of copies. 
                        Aside from Alamat ng Gubat, his other well-known stories are 
                        "ABNKKBSNPLAKo", "Kapitan Sino", "Si", "Lumayo Ka Nga Sa Akin", and other works.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Alamat ng Gubat is the fourth book published by Bob Ong in 2003.
                        The story is written as a humorous and straightforward narrative, 
                        depicting Filipinos' everyday lives. 
                        However, within the humorous story lies a message about the issues of our country.

                        the location of the heart. Buwaya attempts to eat Tong when he runs out
                        of pearls to give, but he escapes.

                        The election quickly fell into chaos, and thus, they settle it with a contest, which Langgam won.

                        Ulang, wanting revenge for Tong's earlier actions. Chaos erupted as the three massacred the animals, while Tong fades out in the process.

                        <p>On one scene, Leon takes advantage of Tong's situation. He tricks Tong through manipulation and even makes false promises
                            to gain his trust and cooperation. This shows people with a higher position exploit or use other people's vulnerability for their own gain.
                            They go to the point where they betray and give false hope because they are aware of one's weaknesses or are aware of their needs.
                            It is important that one is aware of their influence and power and put it to good use and not just to gain more power and become cruel.

                        <p>In the story, Tipaklong, Pagong, and Kuneho are fighting for the position of being the king of the forest. 
                            Due to ongoing bickering, Aso suggested holding an election so that the decision would be fair and systematic. 
                            However, the election was chaotic, with the animals unfairly stealing votes from each other.
                            In the Philippines, this part of the story shows the issue of vote buying.
                            People who are common victims of this kind of bribery are those who are less fortunate. 
                            This kind of act is unfair since it steals the title from people who are more deserving. 
                        </p>

                        <p>The apathy of our society is metaphorically portrayed in the story.
                            the animals have opted to show indifference amidst challenges around them, and is still seen in contemporary Filipino society. 
                            Most of the citizens are numb toward crucial social problems like poverty, unemployment, and inefficiency in the government. 
                            Values such as honesty, friendliness, and community spirit have lost much of their importance in contemporary society 
                            and have been replaced with the search for wealth, power, and personal success. 
                            There can be little doubt that ethics and social cohesion have suffered in this respect.
                        </p>

                    <div class="explanation-item">

                        <p>In the story, Palaka wants to kiss Bibe because one day Palaka will become a handsome man, 
                            but Bibe doesn't want to because he kisses Palaka several times and becomes slimy, which is said to be his mouth. 
                            This mirrors harassment in the Philippines, 
                            which encompasses a range of behaviors that create a hostile environment, 
                            ften manifesting in workplaces, educational institutions, and public spaces. 
                            This issue is exacerbated by cultural norms that may discourage victims from speaking out, 
                            leading to underreporting and a lack of accountability for perpetrators. 
                            The Philippine government has enacted laws aimed at addressing harassment,
                             yet societal attitudes and systemic barriers continue to hinder effective enforcement 
                             and support for those affected. 
                             As awareness grows, it is crucial to foster a culture of respect and accountability to 
                             combat harassment in all its forms.
